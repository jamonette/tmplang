##### Tutorial

This example demonstrates every single feature of the language. Plus modulo,
which it doesn't actually have yet.

```
(let message-even "even"
  (let message-odd "odd"
    (let test-vals (list 0 1 2 3 4 5)
      (let demo-function
        (function-def input-values
          (let first-in-list (first (list input-values))
            (let rest-of-list (rest (list input-values))
              (let first-msg
                (if (= (% first-in-list 2) 0)
                  (list message-even)
                  (list message-odd))
                (if (= (list rest-of-list ()))
                  first-msg
                  (let rest-msgs (function-call demo-function rest-of-list)
                    (concat (list first-msg rest-msgs))))))))
        (function-call demo-function test-vals)))))

output: ("even", "odd", "even", "odd", "even", "odd")
```

That wasn't a question.

##### TODO

* Add a REPL
* Add support for globals
